# ♟ MERGEN: A Chess AI Inspired by the Spirit of Intelligence and Strategy
Mergen is not just a chess engine; it's an artificial intelligence project that bridges the wisdom of the past with the intellect of the future, inspired by the Turkish mythological deity of wisdom and precision.

# 🧠 Inspiration: Who is Mergen?
In Turkish mythology, Mergen is known as the symbol of intelligence, wisdom, and insight. This celestial figure, who never misses a target with his bow, also represents keen intuition, deep understanding, and precise decision-making. In the myths, Mergen is not only a warrior but also a guide and philosopher.
Drawing inspiration from this legendary figure, we have developed a chess AI that bases its moves not only on power but on foresight, balance, and intuition.

# 🔧 Features
- 🎮 **UCI Protocol Support**: Compatible with any chess GUI (Arena, ChessBase, Cute Chess, lichess bots)
- ♟ **Deep Move Prediction**: Mergen evaluates dozens of possibilities with every move using iterative deepening
- 🌀 **Intelligence and Intuition**: Adapts its playing style with advanced algorithms like quiescence search and alpha-beta pruning
- 📚 **Opening Book**: 108 positions with 186 moves covering major openings
- 🎯 **Tactical Awareness**: Quiescence search prevents horizon effect and tactical blindness
- ⚡ **Optimized Performance**: 8.6x search speedup with futility pruning and enhanced evaluation
- 🔍 **Search Enhancements**: Iterative deepening with Principal Variation (PV) tracking
- 🔀 **Multi-Threading**: Lazy SMP parallel search (1-16 threads, 2-4x speedup)
- 📖 **Pawn Promotion Choice**: Select promotion piece (queen, rook, bishop, knight)
- ⏱️ **Smart Time Management**: Adaptive time allocation with support for bullet, blitz, rapid, and classical time controls
- � **Game Persistence**: PGN save/load with full game history
- ✅ **Comprehensive Tests**: 62 unit tests covering all components
- 🛠️ **Developer Utilities**: `parallel_benchmark.py` to spot single vs. multi-thread timing regressions at depth 3

## 💻 How to Run Mergen?

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
Before running Mergen, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python** `3.11.9` (or compatible 3.11.x version)
- **GCC Compiler** (for building the C engine)
  - **Windows:** [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) or similar
  - **Linux/macOS:** GCC is usually pre-installed. If not:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install build-essential   # Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo pacman -S base-devel          # Arch
    xcode-select --install             # macOS
    ```

---

### 2️⃣ Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/haktanpolatt/Mergen.git
    cd Mergen
    ```
2. **Install the required Python libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    The `requirements.txt` includes:
    ```text
    chess
    rich
    ```

---

### 3️⃣ Running the Project

#### 🔹 Step 1 — Build the Engine
Run `Interface.py` first to build and load the C engine:
```bash
python Interface.py
```

- On the first run, Interface.py will:
  - Detect your OS (Windows/Linux/macOS)
  - Automatically compile the C engine into .dll, .so, or .dylib
  - Load it into Python

#### 🔹 Step 2 — Start the Game
After building the engine, you can run the main program:
```bash
python main.py
```

### 4️⃣ Manual Build (Optional)
If you prefer to compile the C engine yourself:

#### Windows (MinGW):
```bash
cd Source\C
gcc -O3 -shared -o Engine.dll Engine.c Board.c MoveGen.c Evaluate.c Minimax.c Move.c Rules.c Zobrist.c TT.c Ordering.c KillerMoves.c -Wno-stringop-overflow
```

#### Linux:
```bash
cd Source/C
gcc -O3 -shared -fPIC -o Engine.so Engine.c Board.c MoveGen.c Evaluate.c Minimax.c Move.c Rules.c Zobrist.c TT.c Ordering.c KillerMoves.c -Wno-stringop-overflow
```

#### macOS:
```bash
cd Source/C
gcc -O3 -shared -fPIC -o Engine.dylib Engine.c Board.c MoveGen.c Evaluate.c Minimax.c Move.c Rules.c Zobrist.c TT.c Ordering.c KillerMoves.c -Wno-stringop-overflow
```
