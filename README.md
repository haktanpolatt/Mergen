# ♟ MERGEN: A Chess AI Inspired by the Spirit of Intelligence and Strategy
Mergen is not just a chess engine; it's an artificial intelligence project that bridges the wisdom of the past with the intellect of the future, inspired by the Turkish mythological deity of wisdom and precision.

# 🧠 Inspiration: Who is Mergen?
In Turkish mythology, Mergen is known as the symbol of intelligence, wisdom, and insight. This celestial figure, who never misses a target with his bow, also represents keen intuition, deep understanding, and precise decision-making. In the myths, Mergen is not only a warrior but also a guide and philosopher.
Drawing inspiration from this legendary figure, we have developed a chess AI that bases its moves not only on power but on foresight, balance, and intuition.

# 🔧 Features
- ♟ Deep Move Prediction: Mergen evaluates dozens of possibilities with every move; it plays not just powerfully but strategically.
- 🌀 Intelligence and Intuition: Unlike traditional engines, Mergen adapts its playing style, showing aggressive or defensive behavior depending on the situation.
- 📚 Mythological Spirit, Modern Engineering: Named after the wise archer of the past, Mergen is built in Python with modern algorithms.
- 🕰️ Evolving Intelligence: Learns from training data, recognizes openings, and remembers opponent strategies.

# 🎯 Why “Mergen”?
Just like the mythological Mergen’s arrow, this AI makes every move on the chessboard with wisdom and precision. The name is more than just a reference—it symbolizes the very character of our AI.
